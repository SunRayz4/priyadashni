              <p>
                Today, the dream of Late Shri Indraman Singh and his children has turned into a reality. With just 5 students, the small school which he started in Bhosari on 15th August 1982 has now become one of the best schools in Pune. Over the years, the number of students has grown to over 15,000, turning the institutionâ€™s name larger with a group of Schools and Colleges in 8 different places.
